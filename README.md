# docker-demo

### A sample for setting up a react application for both production and development using Docker with docker-compose.
### To get started, install docker here => https://docs.docker.com/install/
### Once docker is installed, run docker-compose up from the command line to get a development environment running.

### To get a production build, execute the deploy.sh script from the command line. You may need to change ownership by running `sudo chmod a+x deploy.sh`
